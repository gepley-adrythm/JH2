/**
 * estimateScenarios.ts — the fixed set of construction-loan estimates that get
 * their own prerendered page.
 *
 * Why these exist: the calculator on /financing is a client component, so a
 * crawler that does not run JavaScript sees exactly one estimate, the default
 * $900,000 Scottsdale scenario baked into the prerendered HTML. The crawlers
 * behind the AI answer engines do not run JavaScript. These pages answer the
 * question people actually ask ("what would a $1 million home in Scottsdale
 * cost per month?") in plain, already-rendered HTML, one URL per answer, the
 * same shape as the FAQ and reference-library corpora.
 *
 * The numbers come from the same @workspace/construction-loan module the
 * calculator uses, so a scenario page and the calculator can never disagree.
 * Rate assumptions are stated on every page: they are fixed at build time,
 * while the calculator loads the live 30-year fixed rate.
