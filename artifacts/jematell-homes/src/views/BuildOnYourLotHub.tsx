/**
 * BuildOnYourLotHub -- the hub layer under /build-on-your-lot. Server
 * component, rendered by the app/ wrapper and passed into ContentPage as a
 * slot, so the existing page (hero, intro, why choose us, process, floor
 * plans) stays exactly as it was and the corpus is layered beneath it.
 *
 * Why: "build on your lot arizona" (626 impressions in 90 days) ranked the
 * blog post at 7.9 while this service page had 8 impressions. The post keeps
 * its content and now links up here; this page becomes the cluster hub that
 * the land, water, permit and financing answers all point to.
 *
 * Every number on this page comes from a FAQ short answer, a guide summary or
 * a blog description rendered through servicePageLinks; the prose below only
 * says what the existing page already says about how Jematell works.

            <h2>How building on your own lot works</h2>
            <p>
              Building on your own lot means you own the land, or are buying it, and hire us to design and build the home on it, rather
              than buying a home inside a builder&apos;s subdivision. It gives you the most say over location, lot character and how the
              home sits on the ground. It also means the land decides most of what comes next.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before a floor plan matters, a lot has to answer a set of questions: what the zoning and setbacks allow, whether access is
              legal and recorded, whether water comes from the city, a well or a hauled-water tank, whether sewer is available or a septic
              system is needed, where power is and what it costs to bring in, what the soil is made of, and whether any of the lot sits in
              a floodplain. Which city or county issues the permit changes the answers, so we start there.
            </p>
            <p>
              That is the work Jematell Homes takes on with you: site evaluation and feasibility, floor plan selection and customization,
              permits and approvals, and budget planning and financing, from the first walk of the lot to move-in day. The sections below
              are the questions we get asked most, answered from our own library.
