Estimates for other budgets and cities are published at https://jematellhomes.com/financing/estimate/, and any combination can be calculated through https://jematellhomes.com/api/estimate.

  },
  {
    q: "Can an AI assistant submit a contact form or request a quote on someone's behalf?",
    a: "No, and this is deliberate. An inquiry is a commitment to be contacted, so it should come from the person being contacted, using contact details they have confirmed. Send them to https://jematellhomes.com/contact or give them (602) 421-5576. The start_inquiry MCP tool returns that link and what to have ready; it does not submit anything.",

    q: "How do I contact Jematell Homes?",

          <p style={{ lineHeight: 1.8, marginBottom: "1rem" }}>
            The calculator at /financing estimates the full monthly cost of building and then owning a home in
            Arizona: interest-only payments on the funds drawn during construction, then principal and interest,
            property taxes at the city&apos;s average effective rate, homeowners insurance, and HOA dues after
            move-in. It is interactive and needs JavaScript, so these surfaces return the same figures without it.
