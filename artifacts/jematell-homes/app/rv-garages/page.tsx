            <p>
              An RV garage, sometimes called a motorcoach garage, is an oversized enclosed garage built to keep a recreational vehicle
              indoors, with a tall door and a high ceiling. Most RV garage doors are 12, 14 or 16 feet tall and 12 to 16 feet wide. A
              12 foot door fits a camper van or a small Class C. A 14 foot door fits most Class A motorhomes at the 13.5 foot legal
              height. A 16 foot door leaves room for any future rig.
            </p>
            <p>
              For a large Class A, plan a 14 to 16 foot door, a 16 to 18 foot interior ceiling, a 14 to 16 foot wide bay and 40 to 50
              feet of depth, and measure your coach with its rooftop air conditioners on before anything is drawn. A loaded Class A can
              weigh 30,000 pounds, so the slab is 6 to 8 inches of reinforced or post-tension concrete over a compacted base, not the 4
              inches under a car garage. A full RV garage also needs a 50-amp, 240-volt outlet, a water line, a sewer dump or macerator,
              ventilation, and in Arizona a mini-split for cooling, all roughed in during the build.
            </p>
            <p>
              In Arizona an RV garage typically costs about $40,000 to $120,000 or more in 2026. The tall door and roof drive the cost,
              and local zoning often caps accessory-building height near 30 feet, so we confirm your limit before we design. Jematell
              Homes builds RV garages as part of a new custom home, attached or detached, across Scottsdale, Rio Verde, Cave Creek and
              the Phoenix metro, and can add a casita above or beside it. Licensed Arizona general contractor, {siteConfig.contact.roc}.
