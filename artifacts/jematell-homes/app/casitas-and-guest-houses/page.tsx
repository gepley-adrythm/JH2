              A casita, guest house or accessory dwelling unit (ADU) is a second living space on the same lot as your home.
              Arizona&apos;s 2024 ADU law, <Link href="/reference-library/arizona-building-law/ars-9-461-18-municipal-adu-law-arizona">A.R.S. 9-461.18</Link>,
              requires cities over 75,000 people, including Phoenix, Scottsdale, Mesa, Chandler and Gilbert, to allow at least one attached
              and one detached ADU on a single-family lot, with setbacks capped at five feet and size at 1,000 square feet or 75 percent of
              the main home, whichever is less. Counties follow <Link href="/reference-library/arizona-building-law/ars-11-810-01-county-adu-law-arizona">A.R.S. 11-810.01</Link>.
              Smaller towns like Cave Creek, Carefree and Fountain Hills are not bound by the mandate and allow guest space rather than
              rentable units.
            </p>
            <p>
              The words matter. An ADU is the legal term for a self-contained second home you can rent. A casita is the everyday Southwest
              word for the same building. A guest house is a stricter category in cities like Scottsdale: it cannot be rented, is capped
              smaller, and often has no full kitchen. Which one you build decides the size cap, the utilities, and whether it can ever earn
              rent, so it is the first decision we make with you.
            </p>
            <p>
              Jematell Homes designs and builds detached casitas and guest houses as part of a new custom home or on a lot you already own,
              across Scottsdale, Phoenix, Cave Creek, Rio Verde and the rest of our service area. Expect about $200 to $400 per square foot
              in 2026: a typical 400 to 800 square foot detached casita runs roughly $100,000 to $280,000, and a guest house with no kitchen
              costs less than a full rentable casita. We are a licensed Arizona general contractor, {siteConfig.contact.roc}.
