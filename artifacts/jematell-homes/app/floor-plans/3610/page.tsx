The great room opens through a wall of glass to a covered patio, and a separate game room gives the family a second place to gather. The owner's suite has its own private patio, spa bath, and enormous closet, while three more bedrooms sit on their own wing. Beyond the four-car garage, the plan adds a dedicated shop and a detached out building, so there is space for every vehicle, project, and hobby."
