An open great room, island kitchen, and dining space share one bright footprint that opens to a covered patio, while the owner's suite sits privately at the rear with its own bath and walk-in closet. An attached casita features a second bedroom and a full bath. Plus a guest powder room, round out the living space. The signature feature is the garage: a roomy two-and-a-half-car bay alongside a dedicated, oversized RV garage. This plan can be built without the RV garage."
