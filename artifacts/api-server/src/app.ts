// Canonical host. www.jematellhomes.com and jematellhomes.com both answered 200
// with byte-identical responses (same ETag), so Google indexed the site twice.
// Measured in Search Console, Jul 27-Aug 9 2026: 249 of ~1,010 pages ranked
// under BOTH hostnames, 303 www URLs ranked in total, and the www share of
// impressions was still climbing (22.5% in Jul 13-26 -> 29.8% in Jul 27-Aug 9).
// On several pages the www copy outranked the apex by double digits, so this
// was not resolving on its own.
//
// rel=canonical was already correct on every page and did not fix it — it is a
// hint, not a directive — and Google removed the preferred-domain setting from
// Search Console in 2019. A 301 is the only mechanism that actually merges the
// two. Placed after pino so the redirects are visible in logs while Google
// reprocesses.

// Deliberately an exact-host allowlist rather than a generic "strip the www"
// rule: the *.replit.dev preview hostnames, localhost, and the autoscale health
// check must pass through untouched, and an over-broad rule is exactly how a
// redirect loop takes a site down.

// CANONICAL_HOST_REDIRECT=off disables it without a code change or redeploy —
// a safety valve, since this ships against a site that is under a month old.
