description: Plan and produce a batch of new FAQ content for the Jematell Homes site (lib/faq/src/seed.ts). Use whenever the user wants to add, expand, or research new FAQ questions/answers — especially several at once or "across all markets" — or asks to spin up writer agents for FAQ content. Enforces a duplicate-intent check against CONTENT-INTENT-REGISTRY.md before any drafting so two pages never target the same search intent, then runs the parallel-writer → assembly → pipeline workflow.

# FAQ Content Batch

How to produce a fresh batch of FAQ content for Jematell Homes without creating duplicate pages or corrupting the shared seed. The FAQ corpus lives in `lib/faq/src/seed.ts` (single source of truth, no DB) and is consumed by both the web app and the api-server.

## When to Use

- The user wants new FAQ questions/answers added, or to expand FAQ coverage (e.g. "add FAQs for X", "cover all 8 markets", "more permitting questions").
- The user wants to run multiple writer agents to produce FAQ content in parallel.
- Any time you are about to add more than one or two FAQ entries.

For a single tiny edit to an existing entry you can skip the parallel-writer machinery, but you still MUST do the duplicate check (step 1) and run the full pipeline (step 5).

## Step 1 — Check the registry FIRST (do not skip)

Before writing a single answer, prevent duplicate content. Two FAQ pages must never own the same search intent — it splits ranking and confuses readers.

1. Read `CONTENT-INTENT-REGISTRY.md` at the repo root. It lists every published FAQ URL and the intent it owns (regenerated from the seed; never hand-edited).
2. For each question you intend to write, confirm no existing row already covers that intent. If something is close, either (a) pick a genuinely distinct angle/slug, or (b) plan to expand the existing entry instead of adding a new one.
3. The registry can lag the seed. If you have edited the seed recently, regenerate it first: `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run faq:registry`, then re-read it.
4. The `faq:validate` script also flags duplicate-intent (cosine ≥0.6) at assembly time as a backstop — but catch collisions here, before drafting, to avoid wasted writing.

Capture your planned slugs + one-line intents and sanity-check them against the registry. This list becomes the writer briefs in step 3.

## Step 2 — Decide the batch shape

- Group new questions by FAQ **category** (e.g. `permits-and-codes`, `land-due-diligence`, `water-septic-utilities`, `costs-budget`, `design-zoning-adus`). One category = one writer.
- If a batch needs a brand-new category/topic, note it; the **assembly** step (not the writers) adds it to the seed's `categories`/`topics` arrays (and must give the new category/topic a `sortOrder` that does not collide with existing ones).
- `featured` is **metadata only** — `dataset.featured()` exists but no web page renders it today, so a "pillar" flag changes nothing visible. Set it if you want the semantic marker, but do NOT spend planning effort agonizing over pillar selection or block assembly on it. What actually controls on-page order is `sortOrder` (see assembly pitfalls).

## Step 3 — Parallel writers, each to its OWN draft file

The hard constraint: **writers never touch `lib/faq/src/seed.ts`**. Parallel agents editing the same seed file collide and clobber each other. Instead, each writer drafts paste-ready `item({ ... })` blocks into a dedicated file under `research/faq-drafts/<category>.md`.

Spin up one writer per category (project tasks in Plan mode, or `subagent`/`startAsyncSubagent` in Build mode). Each writer brief must include:

- The category slug + topic slug(s) the entries belong to.
- The specific questions to write (slug + intent from step 1), confirmed non-duplicate.
- The output path `research/faq-drafts/<category>.md` and the rule that NO other file may be modified.
- The schema + voice rules below.
- Pointers: `lib/faq/src/types.ts` (the `SeedItem` shape), `research/jematell-faq-content-plan.md` (the running content plan + numbered sources), and the `faq-seed-pipeline` memory.

### Schema rules for every `item({ ... })` block

Author with the `item()` helper (`Omit<SeedItem,"answer"> & { answerHtml }`), never raw objects. **Wrap each `item({ ... })` block in a fenced ` ```ts ` code block** so the assembly step can extract every block programmatically (the assembler greps for `ts`-fenced blocks; loose blocks get missed).

- `slug` (kebab-case, unique), `question`.
- `answerHtml` — the rich HTML body, 500-1,500 words, using `<p> <h2> <h3> <ul> <ol> <li> <strong>`. The 500-word floor is NOT validator-enforced; an answer under it ships silently. Write to it.
- **Never hand-write the plain `answer` field** — it is derived from `answerHtml` by the `plain()` helper. Writing both reintroduces drift.
- `shortAnswer` (plain, self-contained) and `metaDescription` are **schema/meta only** — they feed JSON-LD and the detail-page lede; they are NOT visible body copy and must not be duplicated into the body. Keep `shortAnswer` **25-80 words** (the validator WARNs outside that range); aim 40-60.
- `categorySlug`, `topicSlugs: [...]`, `tags` (kebab-case).
- `relatedFaqSlugs` — use the **final intended slug** of each target, whether it is a live entry or a sibling being added in the same batch. Every one of these must resolve at assembly or `faq:validate` fails, so do not point at a slug you are guessing about.
- `relatedServiceSlugs` (real services, e.g. `custom-homes`, `build-on-your-lot`).
- `pillarBlogSlug` — a **real** blog slug or `null`, never invented. Verify against the actual blog source (`clone-data/extracted/blogs.json` keys) before using one; when in doubt use `null`.
- `sortOrder` — number your entries sequentially **within your own category**, starting just after the live category's current last value. Ordering is per-category, so cross-category collisions are fine; the assembler finalizes contiguous numbering.
- Below each block add a short "Sources used" list with the plan's `[N]` citation numbers + URLs so the research is auditable.

### Voice + content rules

- Deep, research-phase, plain-language, **Arizona-building-code-grounded**. Cite real statutes/ordinances/agencies by name (e.g. A.R.S. 45-454 exempt domestic well ≤35 gpm, A.R.S. 32-2101 subdivision = 6+ lots vs lot split ≤5, HB 2720 ADU law, Scottsdale ESLO/NAOS, ADWR/ADEQ, the adopted IRC/IBC edition per jurisdiction).
- Close every answer by reminding the reader to confirm specifics with the local Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ), because adopted code versions, fees, and timelines change.
- Date-stamp anything volatile (adopted code editions, fee schedules). Never give legal advice.
- NO em dashes, NO emojis (site-wide preference).
- The 500-word floor is a quality standard, not a validator rule — the validator will not catch a thin answer. Write to it.

## Step 4 — Assembly (main agent merges all drafts)

Once the drafts exist, one assembly pass (best done by the main agent) stitches them into the seed:

1. Paste each `item({ ... })` block into `lib/faq/src/seed.ts` under its correct category section.
2. Add any new category + topic to the `categories` / `topics` arrays.
3. Finalize cross-links: make every `relatedFaqSlugs` resolve to a real slug, set real `relatedServiceSlugs`, assign sensible per-category `sortOrder`.
4. Re-confirm no entry duplicates a live question's intent (cross-check the registry again).

### Assembly pitfalls (learned the hard way)

These are the things that bite the assembler agent. Handle them deliberately:

- **`sortOrder` is per-category, not global.** The dataset groups items by `categorySlug` and sorts within each group by `sortOrder`; the order of blocks in the `items` array does NOT affect rendering. So you must renumber each category to a clean contiguous sequence and only worry about collisions *within* a category. A new category/topic also needs a `sortOrder` that does not collide with the existing categories/topics.
- **Extract, then reindent — don't expect paste-ready indentation.** Draft blocks come at varying indentation. Pull every ` ```ts `-fenced `item({...})` block out of the draft files (programmatically), reindent to the seed's nesting, and insert under the right category section. Expect to script this rather than hand-paste 25+ blocks.
- **Validate every `relatedFaqSlug` against (live ∪ new) before running the pipeline.** Gather all live slugs plus all new slugs into one set and confirm each reference resolves. A dangling ref fails `faq:validate` and is the most common assembly error.
- **Verify each `pillarBlogSlug` is a real blog slug (or `null`).** Cross-check against `clone-data/extracted/blogs.json`. Writers sometimes leave placeholders.
- **`featured` is cosmetic today** (nothing renders it) — do not block assembly deciding pillars. Set it for semantics if you wish, but it is not a release gate.
- **Keep new content em-dash-free.** Site preference is NO em dashes. Some *live* seed entries still contain them; that is not license to add more. Do not copy that habit into new entries (and normalize stragglers only if explicitly asked).
- **Count check before the pipeline.** Expected total `items` = live count + new count (e.g. 13 live + 26 new = 39). A mismatch means a block was dropped or double-pasted during extraction.

## Step 5 — Run the FAQ pipeline IN ORDER (after ANY seed edit)

The generated files derive purely from the seed and go stale silently if skipped. Run all four, in this order:

1. `pnpm run typecheck:libs` — rebuilds `lib/faq` dist so the web app (which imports the built lib, not the TS source) picks up changes.
2. `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run faq:validate` — must be **0 errors** (required fields, valid category/topic/relatedFaq refs, no duplicate-intent ≥0.6, JSON-LD shapes, breadcrumb, related-services when set; shortAnswer 25-80 words or WARN).
3. `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run faq:crosslinks` — regenerates `artifacts/jematell-homes/src/data/faqCrossLinks.json` (consumed by `BlogPost.tsx` for related-FAQ links). Skipping this after slug changes leaves stale/broken links.
4. `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run faq:registry` — regenerates `CONTENT-INTENT-REGISTRY.md` so the next batch's duplicate check (step 1) sees the new pages.

Resolve every validator finding before moving on.

## Step 6 — Verify rendering

Load `/faq`, a couple of topic pages (`/faq/topics/:slug`), and several new detail pages (`/faq/:slug`). Confirm heading, lede (the `shortAnswer`), body, breadcrumbs, related links, and any new category all render. FAQ pages are SSG-prerendered, so also confirm typecheck is clean rather than relying on `build` (which needs workflow env vars).

## Key files

- `lib/faq/src/seed.ts` — the single source of truth (assembly edits this; writers never do).
- `lib/faq/src/types.ts` — the `SeedItem` shape.
- `CONTENT-INTENT-REGISTRY.md` — generated duplicate-intent ledger; read before drafting.
- `research/jematell-faq-content-plan.md` — running content plan + numbered sources.
- `research/faq-drafts/<category>.md` — per-writer draft output (collision-free).
- `.agents/memory/faq-seed-pipeline.md` — deeper pipeline notes (composable with this skill).
